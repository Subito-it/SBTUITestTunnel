/**
 *  SBTWebServer provides its own built-in logging facility which is used by

 *
 *  SBTWebServer is also compatible with a limited set of third-party logging
 *  facilities. If one of them is available at compile time, SBTWebServer will
 *  automatically use it in place of the built-in one.
 *
 *  Currently supported third-party logging facilities are:
 *  - XLFacility (by the same author as SBTWebServer): https://github.com/swisspol/XLFacility
 *
 *  For the built-in logging facility, the default logging level is INFO
 *  (or DEBUG if the preprocessor constant "DEBUG" evaluates to non-zero at
 *  compile time).
 *
 *  It's possible to have SBTWebServer use a custom logging facility by defining
 *  the "__GCDWEBSERVER_LOGGING_HEADER__" preprocessor constant in Xcode build
 *  settings to the name of a custom header file (escaped like \"MyLogging.h\").
 *  This header file must define the following set of macros:
 *
 *    GWS_LOG_DEBUG(...)
 *    GWS_LOG_VERBOSE(...)
 *    GWS_LOG_INFO(...)
 *    GWS_LOG_WARNING(...)
 *    GWS_LOG_ERROR(...)
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: These macros must behave like NSLog(). Furthermore the GWS_LOG_DEBUG()
 *  macro should not do anything unless the preprocessor constant "DEBUG" evaluates
 *  to non-zero.
 *
 *  The logging methods below send log messages to the same logging facility
 *  used by SBTWebServer. They can be used for consistency wherever you interact
 *  with SBTWebServer in your code (e.g. in the implementation of handlers).
