# Setup

## Application target

On the application's target call SBTUITestTunnelServer's `takeOff` method on top of `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`.

    import UIKit
    import SBTUITestTunnelServer

    @UIApplicationMain
    class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        var window: UIWindow?

        func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
            #if DEBUG
                SBTUITestTunnelServer.takeOff()
            #endif

            return true
        }
    }

## ðŸ”¥ Preprocessor macros  

To use the framework you're required to define `DEBUG=1` or `ENABLE_UITUNNEL=1` in your preprocessor macros build settings. This is needed to make sure that test code doesn't end by mistake in production. Make sure that these macros should be defined in both your application target and Pods project.

### Basic usage

Nothing particular needs to be done if you'll be running your test code with a build configuration that already defines `DEBUG=1` and remember to **wrap all calls to the framework around `#if DEBUG`s** as shown in the example above or you may end up getting linking errors that might look something like:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture i386:
  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_SBTUITestTunnelServer", referenced from:
      type metadata accessor for __ObjC.SBTUITestTunnelServer in AppDelegate.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

### Advanced usage

In some advanced cases the `DEBUG=1` may not be defined in your application's target or Pods project. This can happen when using some customly named build_configurations (ie QA) where Cocoapods doesn't automatically set the `DEBUG` preprocessors for you.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Subito-it/SBTUITestTunnel/master/Images/qa_preprocessor_macros.png" width="460" />

In that case you'll need to add `ENABLE_UITUNNEL=1` in your application target build setting as shown above and modify your Podfile by adding the following `post_install` action (and re running `pod install`):

    post_install do |installer|
        installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                if config.name == 'QA' # the name of your build configuration
                    config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)', 'ENABLE_UITUNNEL=1']
                end
            end
        end
    end


## UI Testing target

On the testing target no setup is required. You don't even need to instantiate an `XCUIApplication`, the framework automatically adds an `app` property (`SBTUITunneledApplication`) ready to use.

### Alternative UI Testing target integration

While no setup is required in your UI Test target to use this library it might be that you need fine grained control of the `XCUIApplication` instance. 

In this case adding `ENABLE_UITUNNEL_SWIZZLING=0` in your application target build settings will prevent this library from instantiating an instance of `XCUIApplication` and it won't add an `app` property on your `TestCase` classes.

This is useful if you have your own sub-class of `XCUIApplication` that you wish to use instead of the automatically provided one.

You'll need to create and retain an instance of `SBTUITestTunnelClient` and hook it up with your own `XCUIApplication` sub-class to be able to manage the tunnel client.

#### Fully custom XCUIApplicaion example 

    class MyCustomApplication: XCUIApplication {
        lazy var client: SBTUITestTunnelClient = {
            let client = SBTUITestTunnelClient(application: self)
            client.delegate = self
            return client
        }()
        
        func launchTunnel() {
            // Do any custom launch things
            client.launchTunnel()
        }
        
        override func terminate() {
            // Do any custom tidy up things
            client.terminate()
        }
    }

    extension MyCustomApplication: SBTUITestTunnelClientDelegate {
        func testTunnelClientIsReady(toLaunch sender: SBTUITestTunnelClient) {
            // Call the XCUIApplication.lanuch() method
            launch()
        }
        
        func testTunnelClient(_ sender: SBTUITestTunnelClient, didShutdownWithError error: Error?) {
            // optionally handle errors
            print(String(describing: error?.localizedDescription))
            
            // Call the XCUIApplication.terminate() method
            super.terminate()
        }
    }

    // Example useage in XCTestCase
    class MyTests: XCTestCase {
     
        let app = MyCustomApplication()
     
        override func setUp() {
            super.setUp()
     
            // Call our custom launchApp() method
            app.launchApp()
        }
      
        func testSomething() {...}
    }

The purpose of `SBTUITestTunnelClientDelegate` is to allow the tunnel to prepare before you launch the app and terminate before you terminate the app. Once the tunnel is setup `testTunnelClientIsReady(toLaunch:)` will be called and you should launch the app by calling `launch()`. 

If the tunnel fails to connect for any reason `testTunnelClient(_:didShutdownWithError:)` will be called with a provided `Error` instance. You can then decide whether to terminate the app, fail the test or just fail silently.

To terminate the app yourself you should call `terminate()` on the client instance, this allows the tunnel time to disconnect before the `testTunnelClient(_:didShutdownWithError:)` will be called, though unlike above `Error` will be nil. You can then call `terminate()` on the XCUIApplication instance you're retaining.

#### Part custom XCUIApplicaion Example 

As a convenience you can also sub-class `SBTUITunneledApplication` instead of `XCUIApplication` to get a default implementation that creates the `SBTUITestTunnelClient` and implements the delegate for you with default behaviour:

    class MyCustomApplication: SBTUITunneledApplication {
        // Create other custom methods as needed
    }

     
    class MyTests: XCTestCase {
     
        let app = MyCustomApplication()
     
        override func setUp() {
            super.setUp()
     
            // Call launchTunnel() instead of launch()
            app.launchTunnel()
        }
     
        func testSomething() {...}
    }

This main difference between sub-classing `SBTUITunneledApplication` and using the `automatic` setup approach is that no swizzling is used and you can use your own `XCUIApplication` sub-class. You still need to create and retain an `XCUIApplication` instance in your `XCTestCase` classes.

## Workarounding _UI Testing Failure - Failure getting snapshot Error Domain=XCTestManagerErrorDomain Code=9 "Error getting main window -25204_

To workaround this issue, which seem to occur more frequently in apps with long startup, an additional step is required during the setup of the tunnel in the application target:

Call `SBTUITestTunnelServer.takeOffCompleted(false)` right after `takeOff` (which should be on topo of your `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`)

    import UIKit
    import SBTUITestTunnel

    @UIApplicationMain
    class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
        var window: UIWindow?

        func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
            #if DEBUG
                SBTUITestTunnelServer.takeOff()
                SBTUITestTunnelServer.takeOffCompleted(false)
            #endif

            return true
        }
    }

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥**You then HAVE TO call `SBTUITestTunnelServer.takeOffCompleted(true)` once you're sure that all your startup tasks are completed and your primary view controller is up and running on screen.**

This will guarantee that the tests will start executing once the view hierarchy of the app is ready.
